ðŸ©º Breast Cancer Prediction (ML Models)
This project applies multiple machine learning algorithms to predict whether a breast tumor is benign (not cancerous) or malignant(cancerous) based on nine medical features.

ðŸ“Š Features Used
Clump Thickness

Uniformity of Cell Size

Uniformity of Cell Shape

Marginal Adhesion

Single Epithelial Cell Size

Bare Nuclei

Bland Chromatin

Normal Nucleoli

Mitoses

Target: Class (2 = Benign, 4 = Malignant)

ðŸ“Œ Dataset Source: UCI ML Repo

ðŸš€ Steps
Load and preprocess the dataset

Apply feature scaling

Train and evaluate multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Kernel SVM

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluate models using confusion matrix and accuracy score

ðŸ“Š Model Comparison
Model	Accuracy (%)	TN	FP	FN	TP
Decision Tree	95.9	103	4	3	61
Logistic Regression	95.6	84	3	3	47
Kernel SVM	95.3	102	5	3	61
K-Nearest Neighbors	94.7	103	4	5	59
Naive Bayes	94.1	99	8	2	62
Support Vector Machine	94.1	102	5	5	59
Random Forest	93.6	102	5	6	58

ðŸ§  Tools
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn)
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

âœ… Outcome
Each model is evaluated for accuracy and performance using confusion matrices. Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Kernel SVM showed the best results in predicting breast cancer outcomes.
