# 🩺 Breast Cancer Prediction (Logistic Regression)

This project uses **logistic regression** to predict whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** based on nine medical features.

## 📁 Files

- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb` – Code notebook  
- `breast_cancer.csv` – Dataset  
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 📊 Features Used

- Clump Thickness  
- Uniformity of Cell Size  
- Uniformity of Cell Shape  
- Marginal Adhesion  
- Single Epithelial Cell Size  
- Bare Nuclei  
- Bland Chromatin  
- Normal Nucleoli  
- Mitoses

**Target:** Class (2 = Benign, 4 = Malignant)

📌 Dataset Source: [UCI ML Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Original))

## 🚀 Steps

1. Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. Train logistic regression  
3. Evaluate with accuracy & confusion matrix  
4. Cross-validation for robustness

## 🧠 Tools

- Python (pandas, sklearn)
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## ✅ Outcome

Model predicts tumor type with good accuracy and interpretability.
